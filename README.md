# Exercise 19 - Event delegation

For this exercise, you are going to use event delegation to find out what index or id a button click event is coming from.

You will have to write an event handler and register to listen to the event on click.

The event handler should be registered to the parent UL. There are some instructions to help you, though there are many different ways you could acheive the desired outcome.

Detailed instructions for what JS to add are in your your `javascript-start.js` file. You will not have to update the `HTML` or `CSS` for this exercise.

## Steps

Since you now experts at cloning repos, one option open to you is that you could clone this `Exercise-19` repo and then work on it locally.

If you aren't as comfortable with cloning just yet, you can copy the HTML, CSS and JS files in the main project folder to your local machine and modify the `javascript-start.css` file until you acheive the desired outcome. In this exercise you must not modify the main HTML file or CSS file to acheive the desired outcome.

Please note that you should not be editing the CSS reset file.
